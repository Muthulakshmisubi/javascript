/* Further Adventures
 *
 * 1) Declare variables for a second book
 *    and assign them values.
 *    (Already done)
 *
 * 2) Add code to log its details to the console.
 *    (Already done)
 *
 * 3) Repeat steps 1 and 2 for a third book.
 *    (Already done)
 *
 * 4) Consider the code needed for 10 books.
 *    For 100 books.
 *    We would need to declare and assign values to 10 or 100 sets of variables,
 *    and log each book's details to the console. This would be repetitive and
 *    inefficient. A better approach would be to use arrays or objects to store
 *    the book data, and then loop through the data to log it to the console.
